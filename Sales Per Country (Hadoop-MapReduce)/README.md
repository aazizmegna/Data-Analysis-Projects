# Analysis of the sale of certain products in the world

In this project, I will use Hadoop with MapReduce. The input data that we are going to use is a 
sale products dataset calls SalesJa2009.csv that we can find on kaggle website by clicking on this 
link: https://www.kaggle.com/jensroderus/salesjan2009csv. It contains Sales related information 
like product name, price, payment mode, city, country of client etc. The goal is to find out the
Number of Products Sold in Each Country.

I highly recommend that you take a look at Presentation.pdf file to understand in depth how we are going to do this before starting this project.
